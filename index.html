        <p>I was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado during the swinging sixties, old enough 
            to remember a couple choice Beatles songs NOT being on the oldies station, but rather 
            on top 40 radio as contemporary hits albeit as a baby. Music has shaped my life, given me purpose,
            and provided me with an amazing way to make a living for the last 20 plus years.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I've been lucky enough to record and tour the world with some captivatingly talented artists, as well
            as getting to meet and perform with many of my musical heros, and the chance to converse
            with Presidents, Heads of State, and leaders in the worlds of technology and science.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>It is my hope, that after learning more about coding, and all the other branches connected 
            to it, I will be able to develop apps that will be usuful in the musical world, based on 
            my experiences, and what I see as needs lacking solutions today.
