        I was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado during the swinging sixties,
        hardly old enough to remember some choice Beatles songs NOT being on the
        oldies station, but rather on top 40 radio as contemporary hits! Music
        has shaped my life, given me purpose, and provided me with an amazing
        way to make a living for the last 20 plus years.

        I've been lucky enough to record and tour the world with some
        captivatingly talented artists, as well as getting to meet and perform
        with many of my musical heros, and the chance to converse with
        Presidents, Heads of State, and leaders in the worlds of technology and
        science.

        It is my hope, that after learning more about coding, and all the other
        branches connected to it, I will be able to develop apps that will be
        useful in the musical world, based on my experiences, and what I see as
        needs that are lacking solutions today.
